This project was created with React JS (I usually do TypeScript but wanted a change), I also started experimenting with GSAP for animations (opacity and y-axis animations for text and button in this project). I also used Three.js for this project in order to implement the 3D models for the iPhone 15 Pro & 15 Pro Max. I used TailwindCSS for this project together with custom styles using normal CSS! 🚀
